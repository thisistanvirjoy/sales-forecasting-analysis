# Sales Forecasting & Business Intelligence Dashboard

A comprehensive data analysis project that transforms raw sales data from the US Superstore dataset into actionable business insights through exploratory data analysis and an interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover critical business insights, identify profit optimization opportunities, and present findings through an interactive web dashboard. The analysis reveals significant performance disparities across product categories, regions, and customer segments.

## 📊 Key Findings

### Critical Business Insights
- **Furniture Category Crisis**: -9.06% profit margin despite $242,655 in sales
- **High Loss Rate**: 25% of all orders (531 out of 2,121) are loss-making
- **Technology Leadership**: 11.04% profit margin with $255,595 in sales
- **Regional Disparities**: West region leads with 5.45% profit margin vs Central region's -0.68%
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Strong Q4 performance with December peak ($98,765 sales, $4,124 profit)
- **Discount Impact**: Higher discount rates strongly correlate with lower or negative profits

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core analysis and data processing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Statistical visualizations
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Interactive dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis documentation
